Newcomer: A guide for new Berliners

## 0.1 Introduction
The idea of the project Newcomer is a result of multiple conversations with immigrants and expats in Berlin who were puzzled about the German Bureaucracy and opportunities in terms of work contracts. In one such conversation, a simple question arose: “Is it possible to get a mini-job contract while holding a freelancer visa?”. The answer to this question is quite tricky as it depends on each particular case and Nationality. To answer the question, yes, it is possible to be a freelancer and work in a mini-job at the same time if you have relocated from other EU countries- a status that gives them special rights and benefits. However, people from outside the EU that hold these types of visas are not allowed - at the beginning - to get a work contract. If this happens, getting a work contract might provide the authorities enough reason to void a valid visa and kick somebody out of the country. In order to avoid any confusion, many immigrants do not risk taking a mini-job. Newcomer/ web-app aims at providing solutions to these uncomfortable ambiguities. 

The initiative behind Newcomer was to create an app that presents the user with a simple straight-forward explanation of their rights, tasks, benefits, and obligations, both before and after coming to Berlin. After signup, the user is provided a personalized track to decipher the different challenges that pop-up during their visa application and city integration process. The app guides them to create a routine that will make them confident enough to triumph over the bureaucratic hassles after their arrival. For increased user engagement, the entire app is gamified, right from the option of selecting avatars, progressing through different levels of bureaucratic hierarchy and playing games that educate the user of the notorious Berlin scams or deals, for some entertainment.
We started by having multiple brainstorming sessions to seek answers to relevant questions like - “what can be realistically done in one month, with our given skillset?, “what value will the app provide?” “Are other apps doing the same thing?” and many more. All of these sessions were conducted on Miro. 

Since we had a limited amount of time during our boot-camp and the entire concept is quite extensive, we decided to shrink the scope of our project to focus on creating the web-version of the app. The MVP was limited to creating an app to help expats succeed in their integration process in Berlin by providing a better understanding of its rules, dynamics and culture.

Since we couldn't find other apps with the same concept, we looked at other learning and habit-development apps like Duolingo, Primer, Grasshopper, Educated for some inspiration. This process helped us to have a better understanding of user flows, the importance of having a “dashboard” as a welcome page, a clear user interface, and a recognizable learning path for the user.

## 0.2 User Research results
In order to have a better understanding of user needs we decided to conduct a research by doing a google forms survey. The main objective of the research was to unearth all the possible obstacles that potential users might experience during their relocation and integration to Berlin. We included questions related to their age, level of education, current visa conditions, reason for relocation, and their biggest challenges with respect to each type of bureaucratic task, right from getting an anmeldung to filing their tax returns. The survey was posted on several facebook and slack groups. The survey link can be found here “”

Among the survey responses we can highlight the fact that 65% of the participants passed through a visa application process and 36% of them consider it as a difficult process. Another aspect to highlight is the diversity of age, nationalities, visa types and reasons for relocation of the respondents. 

In terms of simple challenges of integration, more than 24% percent affirmed that they had problems to make their city registration (Anmeldung) and more than 50% informed problems at the moment of opening a bank account in Germany. Also, another result shows that 80% of the respondents still have issues understanding how the german tax system works.

The second objective of the survey was to know if the people were interested in downloading and testing an app that would help them to solve these everyday challenges. The results show that around 50% of the respondents are keen to download an app of this type, 44% might download it, and just 6% said they are not interested in it. Also, it is important to say that 45% percent of the users wouldn’t mind using both the app and a website to find help on these matters.
## 0.3 We also created a priority list of categories to be included based on the user research results.
In general, the research provided the expected results and gave the team a better perspective about the potential user difficulties and challenges during their integration to Berlin. It was decided that the  major pain points related to anmeldung, housing and utilities, health Insurance, transportation and taxes would be included in the first phase of the project.

Personas and Case scenarios

Considering the diversity of our potential users, we decided to create multiple models of personas based on their demographics, immigration status, and also motivations, and frustrations about their lives in Berlin. The personas included the demographics and immigration status of the user, along with his immediate goals, upcoming tasks and biggest challenges. All the personas can be found here “link”



The different outcomes from this process lead us to think on different possible case scenarios that could result in personalized tracks for each of them: For example, A foreign freelancer that prioritizes its duties with the tax office and yearly tax declarations, an ausbildung student would need to improve his/her/their German skills and find a praktikum, a young professional that is looking for job opportunities in Berlin would have to adapt the CV to the local job market. Generating multiple personas helped us create progresive disclosure of user flows for different scenarios. 

Customer Journey Map

If the user were to come across our app and use it, we need to have an understanding about the channels through which the user interacts and his emotions at the given time. We created a simple customer journey map, filling ourselves in the users shoes, and essaying what would be the users goals, assumptions, expectations, pain points, emotions, thoughts, problems and opportunities, in each phase of the app-use - right from the time he discovers the app, to the time he uses it, to the downtime and support and finally deletion. 

## 0.4 Content and information architecture
Due to the scope of the project and its “personalized track” feature, it is of utmost importance that the content is thoroughly organised. Since the entire project is based on progressive disclosure, we used all the possible case scenarios for each user depending on his nationality and age, and designed the information architecture vast enough to suit our app needs. It was decided that the content flows would be defined by conditional logic trying not to exclude any particular case. Further, we developed user-flows to suit every type of long-term visas, nationality, age, profession. If the user is not yet in Berlin, they will be provided tips for securing the visa and some assistance with the pre-departure relocation tasks. If they are already in Berlin, they will be encouraged to take up the bureaucratic responsibilities, one at a time. The entire architecture can be found here “link”


## 0.5 Branding and Visual Design
In order to have maximum user engagement, we then started to work on the visual aspects of the app before creating our prototype. Multiple versions of the logo, taglines, and colour palettes were generated and iterated. Our objective was to create a brand identity that was connected to Berlin and its cultural identity. It was finally decided to include multiple shades of  the black, white, and yellow colours, taking reference from Berlin’s transport system and Alexanderplatz TV tower.
Wire-framing/ Lo-fi Prototyping
We created multiple lo-fi frames to ease the user-flow and a basic usability testing was conducted among the team members to check the most feasible user-flow. 
This was followed by creating a working  figma prototype of the web-app. The major components like buttons, checkboxes, colour-palette, icons, fonts and all its variants were created as a first step. Then we created the first three pages- i.e. the “login/signup”, the “select your profile page” and the “profile complete” page. After a couple of  iterations and brainstorming sessions, we then started to design the user flow to suit each type of user. The user is greeted with an illustration and can sign-up. He gets to choose an avatar, and sets up his profile by selecting his nationality. Then he gets to choose his personalised track depending on whether the user is already in Berlin or yet to reach Berlin. The data presented to the user is in the form of progressive disclosure. The UI progresses naturally, from simple to complex and does not overburden the user. This is because information presented to someone who isn't interested in it, or isn't ready to process it - is noise.  

After finishing each task, he can mark the task as complete to earn some virtual beer/drink/points. Higher the tasks completed, higher the chance to top the leaderboard.  
In addition, to gain additional points, the user can take part in activities at the end of each category or play the game Newcomer v/s Berlin 1.1. The activity generally includes a simple quiz related to the task that the user has chosen.

Taking inspiration from the German recycling systems, we created a points system wherein the user virtually recycles the drink bottles to get a final “Pfand” score. The user  gets a chance to buy different items from the “Pfand” accumulated, starting from a carton of milk, all the way up to becoming the mayor of Berlin.

As he progresses through the levels, he is presented with tracks to choose from. And with each progression of level, his avatar icon on the sidebar gets upgraded from being a tourist - to an expat - to a pro-Berliner. 

The entire figma prototype can be found here

## 0.6 All the illustrations were created using Adobe illustrator and animated using Adobe XD.
The Game Newcomer v/s Berlin 1.1 educates the user about the possible bureaucratic hassles and scams if he is not vigilant. On the other hand if he is cautious enough, he gets awarded the best deals. The game was inspired by reminiscing about the childhood Mario game, and the internet Dino game that would have entertained you at some point when the internet was down. To build the game, we used Axure Rp and added conditional logic wherein the user gets a shock after coming in contact with a notorious scam/hassle, thus resetting the score to zero. On the other hand, he gets bonus points for collecting a deal. The game prototype can be played here “https://rjnrgc.axshare.com/#id=1n33cu&p=page_1”

The user needs to overcome obstacles like ATM skimming, rental scam  or jaywalking.
                          
The user is awarded bonus points if he chooses a supermarket or online deal or recycles his trash.
                            
## 0.7 Usability Testing

To check the feasibility of the user-flow in our prototype, we conducted user feedback with Maze’s remote testing platform.

The test results show that around 99% of users are able to create a user profile without any hassles. This is a positive outcome because from a UX standpoint, we live in the age of information overload, a user is always burdened with tons of information and can be easily distracted.
The chances of making a mistake could be even higher as people don’t always see or read everything on the screen. We have tried to eliminate this by making the prototype more interactive and illustrative. 




Since we were able to finish only the desktop version of the app, we weren’t able to check the responsiveness on different devices.

## 0.8 Challenges and Pain Points.
The main paint points and block outs of the project were mostly related to the web development side. The size of the web development team and the lack of advanced knowledge about the tools lead to some confusion at the moment of taking decisions about the coding structure and back end tools to be implemented. Fortunately, thanks to the help of Tech Labs coordinators and our new mentor, the WD team received the right advice and cleared the way to start to develop the webapp. 
Two members of the team left the course during the project phase, making the team lose the members in charge of data science and the half of the team in charge of web development, creating not only a lack of data science approach but also generating a bigger burden on the only member that left in charge of the coding and development phase. This made us reduce the scope of our project goals in terms of web development but we decided to try to have as much progress as possible



## 0.9 Coding and Development
The web development started with making a first version of the sign up login and login page with HTML 5 and CSS 3.

 

Once that was set up, we needed to think about the functionality and set up the back end, and we used the  Firebase authentication which was linked to the project with Javascript.
The content was taken from the Miro board, that the UX team designed and conducted a research for.

A very simple prototype was created, featuring some dynamic features such as uploading a profile picture, change a name (Saved in Firestore), an interactive set of questions to determine the visa (JSON Files), update the “Pfand” score through crossing off the different steps (gamification) and also some static pages with the most important steps to integrate in Berlin, which are accessible through the authentication process with Firebase.



It is clear that the webApp is still underdeveloped, as more developers and content creators are needed. But in the future, the app could be deployed, the personalized track can be extended to the contents that the users want to see or not, along with quizzes and games. A better back-end and interaction with the database could also be developed. 



The goal is to develop a mobile- App and a webApp as close as the intended UX prototype and as ideas come along, many more features should come.
## 0.10 Future plans and other considerations about the project
Though progress achieved during these last 4 months is considerable, there are still many things to be considered in order to launch the webapp.

The first aspect to consider will be to rethink the project idea and content by including concepts taken from Sociology, Anthropology and Migrations science theory. Considering that the project has a social impact goal, as it involves immigrant/expat integration, is it mandatory to proceed with the ideation process taking in consideration concepts and theories from diverse social sciences such as Migratory process, types of migrations, migratory act, settlement, integration, inclusion, networking, globalization, etc. Having the right knowledge about this discipline of studies will let us ideate under certain guidelines and create an effective user flow and content.
Also, theoretical frameworks from other disciplines could take part to explore the historic, economic and cultural aspects of the different migrations process that take place nowadays.

The second thing to take in consideration will be to recreate the prototype for a multi-platform responsive app that is suitable both for desktop and mobile formats. In order to be successful in its goals, the Newcomer should be accessible for all types of users and devices.


Further, we need to add features that would foster user engagement such as notifications and reminders. From an educational perspective, we need an appealing  user interface to inculcate the learning habits to a new user, so that the necessary different challenges presented are fulfilled. 

Once the project is strategically reframed and developed, we would like to collaborate with other  public and private sectors which are working on similar fields. We are conscious that projects with social impact are necessary to solve contemporary social issues such as the ones related to expat and immigrant integration.
## 0.11 Conclusion

The problem related to immigrants' social and cultural integration is a big challenge for almost every society. Providing access to the right information about the system and its rules could be a key aspect in providing help to relocating individuals and their families in their arrival, and further integration in their city of destination, and their personal success. The social impact that this project might have has been a strong motivation for us to develop and execute it.

Another relevant aspect of the concept is its replicability. The app model could be developed in different cities and countries around the world. Our project is certainly Berlin oriented, due to the fact that German capital attracts millions of people from the whole country and all around the world. In addition, the swift pace of gentrification and internationalization in the city, makes a deep transformation in the social landscape, which presents new challenges to its development. To address these unconventional concerns, and solving contemporary social challenges, the use of innovative media and relevant technology with efficient user interface will be of utmost importance.

SUMMARY

Newcomer is a guide that aims to help immigrants integrate to the city of Berlin.

It is an interactive web app that provides a personalized track with a simple user interface design. After providing some relevant information during the sign up process, the platform will provide a personalized track for each user where they could find different tasks and challenges that users have to complete in order to succeed with their integration to the city of Berlin. From anmeldung, to opening a bank account, registering as a freelancer or changing to another health insurance, the webapp aims to provide tips and solutions to New Berliners' everyday problems and let them see the city system and lifestyle from a different perspective. 

The Newcomer prototype was built by a multidisciplinary team of 5 people from UX design and Web Development Tracks and was created aiming to highlight the user flow through a vast variety of content.
