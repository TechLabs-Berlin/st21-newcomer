    The city is almost completely flat and has pretty decent cycle lanes so it’s really a great city to cycle around.

    Where to buy a bicycle?
     Go for a second-hand model either via a shop or try your luck with classified ads such as eBay Kleinanzeigen, Facebook groups.
    Check flea market ( but just bear in mind that there’s a high likelihood it will have been stolen).

you wanna bring a car from EU country
If your car is used then you can bring it to Germany free from any customs duty providing you have proof VAT was paid in its country of origin. You may also need to able to show:
<li>Proof of ownership</li>
<li>Original registration papers</li>
<li>Proof of insurance</li>
<li>Emissions test certificate if the car is more than three years old</li>
<li>Certification from the German Federal Motor Vehicle registry that the car has never been registered in Germany.</li>
If your car is ‘new’, that is less than six months old or with less than 6000 km in mileage, then you will probably have to pay the 19% German VAT. If you already paid the VAT in the country of origin then you should be able to get a reimbursement upon registration of the car in Germany.
You will need an Anmeldung for your vehicle as well.
