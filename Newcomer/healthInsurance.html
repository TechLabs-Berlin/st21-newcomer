    <p class="questions">Who needs health insurance?</p>
<div class="answers2">
<li>Full-time employment in Germany</li>
<li>People who don’t have full-time employment in Germany yet.</li>
<li>Foreign students coming to study at a German university.</li>
<li>People coming to an internship, language course, as an au-pair or visiting scientist.</li>
<li>A freelance visa or a job seeker visa holder</li>
<li>All German residents must have adequate coverage. That’s the law.</li></div>

<p class="questions">Public (Gesetzlich)</p>
<div class="answers2">
     Public providers contributions are set by law (between ≈ 14% & 17%) of your gross income. As an employee, this is paid in part by your employer. Any relative without income of their own can be insured for free under your policy. The vast majority of the German population is with public providers.
Employees earning less than  64.350€ a year.  (Compulsory)
Students under 30 currently enrolled in a German university
Relatives that don’t have their own income can be covered for free, with the same policy and the exact same benefits.
It’s always depending on your income. If your job situation should fail, or your income goes down, you are guaranteed the same level of service at a lower price.
If you lose your job, unemployment benefits cover will pay for your contributions.
Preexisting conditions, chronicle conditions, heavy handicaps have no impact on your contributions. Providers cannot refuse to take you on.
Practitioners tend to prioritize private patients over public ones
Expect some treatments to be only partly covered. In this case, you’d need to pay extra from your pocket.
Depending on your current income and health status, you may find it overly expensive.

<p class="questions">Private (Privat)</p>
<div class="answers3">
    Private providers contributions are set by an assessment of your health risks. As an employee, this is paid in part by your employer. Any relative without income of their own needs to be insured via an extra-paid policy.
   <li>You can choose when you earn more than  64.350€ a year as an employee.</li> 
    <li>An option for freelancers or for people who don’t qualify for the public system for any number of reasons</li>
    <li>Best suited for people with no kids or with a strong retirement plan or students over 30 no public Krankenkasse will take on or freelancers that arrive from a non-EU country.</li> 
    <li>An overall better access to higher-quality treatments, material & medical supplies</li>
    <li>Easier and faster access to specialists, senior staff at hospital.</li>
    <li>Lower costs short term & mid term (when young and healthy)</li>
    <li>Higher costs long term: the more you age and/or have conditions, the higher the costs will be.</li>
    <li>Coming back to the public system after being in the private one is also extremely difficult if not impossible for freelancers.</li>
    
    <li>Visa applicants can use special cheaper “expat” policies for their initial applications, but should make sure to pick wisely. Not all providers fulfill requirements for the immigration office.</li>
    <li>Freelancers have to bear all costs on their own. Artists can apply for special support to cover half the contributions though.
        Students are eligible to special cheaper rates and conditions.</li>
    <li>If you are under 30 and enrolling in a university program in Germany, you have to take on a German public health insurance. You have let the university know which Krankenkasse you picked (required Anmeldung).
        It is required to obtain a residence permit or even enroll in a university. Germany is usually not very good at recognizing non-EU systems so make sure your health insurance is valid for the German system.</li></div>
    

<p class="questions">   Coverage abroad</p>
<div class="answers"> 
 
 Of course when you go home to visit your family and simply go abroad for holidays in Europe, your German health insurance will cover you and giving your reference number should be enough to be reimbursed in the end. Be careful though, you will be reimbursed at the rate that is considered normal for that particular treatment in Germany, so while it will probably cover most of the costs, the rest will come from your pocket in some cases.
