# st21-newcomer
Newcomer is a Web-app that is designed to guide expats to integrate into the city of Berlin.

It is an interactive and illustrative web-app that provides the user with a personalized track based on their Nationality. After signup, the user is given a task-list that guides them through the different challenges that they might face, all the way from submitting the visa application to the city integration process. The app chaperones the user to create a routine that will make them confident enough to triumph over the bureaucratic hassles after their arrival. For increased user engagement, the entire app is gamified, right from the option of selecting avatars, progressing through different levels of bureaucratic hierarchy and indulging in games that educate the user of the notorious Berlin scams or deals.
The Newcomer prototype was built by a multidisciplinary team of four UX/UI designers and a web developer with an aim of providing the user with relevant data via progressive disclosure.
