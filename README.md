Why newcomer?

Newcomer is a guide that aims to help immigrants integrate to the city of Berlin.
It is an interactive web app that provides a personalized track with a simple user interface design.The webApp aims to provide tips and solutions to New Berliners' everyday problems and let them see the city system and lifestyle from a different perspective. 

Here is a small prototype of the webApp

How to use:
The user has to download the Newcomer files and start up by opening “Authentication.html”, and clicks on “Signing up”, after signing up with his/her e-mail address the user goes back to the “Authentication Page”, and can log in. He/She will be redirected to the “dashboard.html” 
He/She can upload a profile picture, type in their name, and start seeing the content, after completing the steps, he can cross the step off and the score would be updated.

Languages/Database used:
Front-end
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

Back-end:
JSON Files
Firestore Database
Firebase Authentication

Why those languages?
As a front-end developer student, it is easier to get started with HTML, CSS and Javascript. As there was only a two month learning period, there was not enough time to master a more dynamic language as React.

What is there to do:
-Add more content
-More dynamic personalization
-More Interaction with the database
